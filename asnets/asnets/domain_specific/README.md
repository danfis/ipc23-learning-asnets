# Domain-specific code/tools

This directory contains a few types of tools:

- Tools for visualising certain environments. This can be useful to get a
  feeling for how a domain is *meant* to be solved, and for whether the
  information supplied to ASNets is adequate to solve it.
- Domain-specific planners for testing whether ASNets can emulate certain kinds
  of strategies for a given domain.
